I am a fan of PyCharm IDE. To set up your development environment in PyCharm Community Edition and link it with GitHub using a virtual environment (venv), follow these steps:

#### Prerequisites:
> * [Install Pycharm](/post/helper/setup_pycharm/)
> * [Virtual Environment](/post/helper/setup_venv/)
> * [Set Up Github Account](/post/helper/setup_github/)


Choose a location for your project and give it a name.

Select the interpreter (I usually choose Python). 

Initialize a Git repository:
In the terminal, ensure you are in the project directory and activate the virtual environment.
Run the following command to initialize a Git repository:
csharp
Copy code
git init
Link your project to a GitHub repository:
Create a new repository on GitHub (https://github.com/new) without initializing it with a README, .gitignore, or license.
Copy the repository URL (e.g., https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git).
In PyCharm, go to "VCS" > "Git" > "Remotes."
Click on the "+" button to add a new remote.
Enter a name for the remote (e.g., "origin") and paste the repository URL.
Click "OK" to save the remote configuration.
Commit and push your code:
In the PyCharm IDE, create or import your Python files as needed.
Use the Git integration in PyCharm to stage and commit your changes.
After committing, select "VCS" > "Git" > "Push" to push your code to the GitHub repository.
Provide your GitHub credentials if prompted.
Your project is now set up in PyCharm Community Edition with a virtual environment, and your code is linked to a GitHub repository. You can continue developing your project, committing changes, and pushing them to GitHub as needed.
