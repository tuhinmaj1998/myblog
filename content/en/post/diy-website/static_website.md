Understanding static websites is essential before delving into creating and hosting them. Here's a brief explanation:

## Building Block
Static websites are web pages that are built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and remain unchanged unless manually updated. Unlike dynamic websites that generate content on the fly and rely on server-side processing, static websites are pre-rendered and consist of fixed files that are served directly to the user's browser.

The core technology behind static websites is **HTML** (Hypertext Markup Language), which defines the structure and content of web pages. HTML uses tags to mark up elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, and more. These tags provide structure and meaning to the content and enable the browser to render the page correctly.

**CSS** (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style the HTML elements and control their visual presentation. With CSS, you can define fonts, colors, layout, and other aspects of the page's appearance. It allows you to create a cohesive and visually appealing design for your website.

**JavaScript** can also be incorporated into static websites to add interactivity and enhance the user experience. It enables dynamic behavior such as dropdown menus, form validation, image sliders, and more. However, it's important to note that static websites primarily rely on HTML and CSS.

## Use Case
Static websites are typically lightweight, load quickly, and are easy to host and maintain. They are well-suited for content that doesn't require frequent updates or complex functionality. Common use cases include personal blogs, portfolios, landing pages, documentation sites, and small business websites.

By understanding the nature of static websites and their underlying technologies, you'll have a solid foundation for creating and hosting your own static web pages.
