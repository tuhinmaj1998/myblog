This part is delightfully straightforward. GitHub has simplified the hosting process by handling all 
the complex server-level tasks. All that's left is to select the desired branch and deploy the website.

&nbsp;

### Go to Pages Settings
Enter in your repository > Go to Settings > Click over Pages Tab

### Website Link Generated

This usually takes about 2-5 minutes. Once done, simply refresh the page, 
and you'll be greeted with a message like the one below.
