[//]: # (### Introduction)



## Just Why
Yeah, because who needs a website, right? 

Having your own little corner on the web to showcase your work, share your thoughts, or promote your business is totally overrated. 
Who wants to stand out, establish an online presence, or connect with a global audience? 
Plus, maintaining a website is a piece of cakeâ€”no need to worry about branding, customization, or controlling your own content. 
And forget about boosting credibility or expanding your reach beyond social media platforms. 

So, yeah, having your own website is not just a waste of time and effort. Who doesn't need that kind of exposure, professionalism, and control, anyway?

## Static Website
Let's make it simple. We ain't going to build e-commerce website today, but one day we'll. 
Static websites have gained popularity due to their simplicity, faster loading times, and enhanced security. Unlike dynamic websites that rely on server-side processing, static websites consist of fixed HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that are served directly to the user's browser. 
This makes them easier to create, manage, and deploy. [Learn more about Static Website](/post/diy-website/static_website/)
