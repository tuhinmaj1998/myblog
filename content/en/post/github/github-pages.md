## User/Organization Pages 
GitHub Pages offers flexibility in terms of deployment options. You can create project-specific pages to showcase individual projects or use user/organization pages for personal or business-focused websites.

## Markdown and Jekyll Support
GitHub Pages supports Markdown, a lightweight markup language, allowing you to write content more efficiently. Additionally, if you choose to use Jekyll, a static site generator, GitHub Pages has built-in support for Jekyll, making it easy to generate and deploy static sites.
