While GitHub Pages offers many advantages, it's important to be aware of its limitations:

Server-Side Functionality: GitHub Pages is limited to hosting static websites only. It doesn't support server-side processing or dynamic content generation, so you can't use server-side languages like PHP or databases like MySQL.

Limited Storage and Bandwidth: GitHub Pages has usage limits on storage and bandwidth. If your website exceeds these limits, you may experience issues with availability or be required to upgrade to a paid hosting service.

Build Times: If you're using Jekyll or other static site generators, the build process can take some time, especially for larger websites. You may experience delays in seeing updates reflected on your live site.

Lack of Server-Side Security: Since GitHub Pages is a static hosting service, it doesn't provide server-side security measures like firewalls or advanced server configurations. It's important to implement security measures in your code and be mindful of potential vulnerabilities.

Customization Restrictions: While you can customize the frontend of your website, there are some limitations imposed by GitHub Pages. You may not have complete control over server configurations or be able to install custom plugins or extensions.

Dependence on GitHub: GitHub Pages is tightly integrated with GitHub, so any issues or downtime on the GitHub platform can impact your website's availability.

Despite these limitations, GitHub Pages remains a popular choice for hosting static websites due to its ease of use, seamless integration with Git, and cost-effectiveness for personal and small-scale projects.
